/**
 * Office NOC Manager - Block Editor Scripts
 * 
 * This file is a placeholder for future Gutenberg block editor enhancements.
 * Currently, all blocks are server-rendered via PHP render callbacks in class-gutenberg-admin.php.
 * 
 * If you want to add JavaScript-based Gutenberg blocks in the future, you can:
 * 1. Import WordPress block dependencies here
 * 2. Register blocks using registerBlockType
 * 3. Build with: npm run build
